#!/bin/bash
# Creates (if needed) and trusts a local, self-signed code-signing certificate
# named RelayLocalSign in your login keychain.
#
# Why this exists: build.sh signs Relay.app with this identity instead
# of ad-hoc ("-") signing. Ad-hoc signatures are derived from the binary's own
# hash, so every rebuild looks like a "different app" to macOS -- which means
# any one-time permission grants would get reset on every rebuild too. A
# stable certificate-based identity fixes that, as long as the certificate is
# also *trusted*. This script does both: create the identity, and trust it
# for code signing.
#
# Everything here is scoped to your own login keychain -- no sudo, no
# system-wide trust changes.
